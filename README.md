Application done as exercise through course on udemy.com

This is most complete and biggest project/exercise I have worked on for now. I  was guided by videos of the course and it was lots of fun going through it and learning.

It is a blog page that alows users to make their accounts, white their blog articles and add them categories. They can also view other users profiles and articles.

There is also option for user to be administrator and have ability to edit or delete other users articles.
